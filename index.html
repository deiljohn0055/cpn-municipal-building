            <br>
            <p>Concepcion is one of the largest municipalities of the province of Tarlac. It is 7.5 kilometers from the
                Capas junction along McArthur Highway. It lies on the south-eastern tip of Tarlac, bordered in the south
                by Magalang, Pampanga, in the east by San Antonio, Nueva Ecija, in the north-east by La Paz, in the
                north-west by Tarlac City, in the west by Capas, and in the south-west by Bamban. It covers an area of
                245.7 square kilometres (94.9 sq mi).
<br><br>
                It has two great rivers, the first being Lucong River which originates from Dingding and Namria creeks
                in Capas, Tarlac; it is visible from the bridge at Barangay Santiago, and merges with the Rio Chico
                before joining the Pampanga River. The second is Parua River, which originates from the Sacobia-Bamban
                river that comes from Mount Pinatubo. Parua River is heavily silted with 7 meters of sand deposits; its
                bridge was destroyed by lahar and is visible at Barangay San Nicolas Balas. It also merges with the Rio
                Chico before joining Pampanga River. Both rivers are utilized to irrigate the town's agricultural lands,
                consisting mainly of rice and sugar crops. Parua River, which at times appears as a bed of sand due to
                the scarcity of water, is also a quarry site for sand and ash used as construction material.

            <h1><b>ABOUT CONCEPCION</b></h1>
            <br>
            <p> In 1860, the towns of Concepcion and Magalang comprised a single town named San Bartolome (presently a
                barangay of Concepcion), which was a military Commandancia of Pampanga under the Spanish regime.
                
                A catastrophic flood devastated the whole settlement of San Bartolome in 1863 and its residents were
                left with no other choice but to abandon the place. Divided as to where they were to resettle, some went
                north and others went south.

                The first group, headed by Don Pablo Luciano, the Governadorcillo, organized a new settlement on the
                slopes of Mt. Arayat further south and named the settlement after him. Eventually, the place was renamed
                Magalang.
                <br><br>
                The second group who took refuge in the north comprised the Santoses, Laxamanas, Salvadors, Yumuls,
                Castros, Dizons, Pinedas, Felicianos, Aquinos, Corteses, Bermudezes, Perezes, Punsalangs and many
                others, and settled in a place (now called Santo Nino) then occupied by the Lindos and the Amuraos (Don
                Esquolastiquo Amurao and Don Gaston Amurao).

                Most of the settlers became dissatisfied with the place, as it abounded with snakes and was scarce in
                water. They moved further south to a place now known as Concepcion. The settlers began clearing the land
                and built huts and roads. After several years, they named the place Concepcion after the Immaculate
                Conception, who was believed to possess power over the snakes that abound in the area.
